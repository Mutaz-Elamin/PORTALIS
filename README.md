## Introduction
Portalis is the prototype of our game created for the coursework one of ECS657U (Multi-Platform Game Development) module. The game is a simplified version built purely off of the identified core features to allow for testing of implementation
and effectiveness of features at providing and appropriate and enjoyable player experience. The goal of this version of our game is to explore the environment around the player while evading and fending off enemies to find the necesary items,
allowing the player to eventually escape.
